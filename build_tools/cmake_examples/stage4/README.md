# Stage 4

This is similar to **Stage 3** but the files are slightly different.

Stage 3 -> Stage 4:

- #include "lib/hello-time.h" -> #include "hello-time.h"
- #include "main/hello-greet.h" -> #include "hello-greet.h"

To build this example, use

```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
make run
```
